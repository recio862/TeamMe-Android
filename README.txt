1. When first signing into the app, the user can either login or register a new account. You can use a real or dummy email to register. Feel free to use admin@admin.com with password admin if you have trouble registering or prefer not to register. (We donâ€™t send you any emails, its a quick easy register).


2. This app has not been tested to work on emulators. 


3. The UI of the application was optimized for a Samsung Galaxy Nexus i9250 with screen with 720 x 1280 pixels, 4.65 inches (~316 ppi pixel density).


4.  This app requires an internet connection. Not having a connection may cause app to crash or not work properly. A Geolocation services connection is also required.

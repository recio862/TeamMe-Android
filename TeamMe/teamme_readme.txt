TeamMe! Requirements and Dependencies:

1) This app requires the user to have an active internet connection. The google maps api loads
information through the network and the markers that the users create to store their games will 
also require internet as they are stored in an external server. Location manager will also be 
used to bring the map screen to the user's current location.

2) The app uses Google Play Services and JSON Parser as external libraries that are required to 
provide the maps (Google) and load the server data (JSON Parser).

3) The app requires an API level of 14 and uses a target API level of 17. The app is formatted and
designed for mobile phones but it will still work for larger devices such as tablets. It may not work 
with emulators because Google Maps has compatibility issues with some of them.
